      <h2>The Pairings: Our Favourite Ales with Brunch</h2>

      <p>We all love beer. But we know that it can be such a tedious job trying to pair the best flavours together with food. So as a favour to you, we did the heavy lifting and you paired some of America's top brunch meals with our favourite ales. Ready to find your new favourite bear breakfast pairing? Check them out now:</p>

            <h3>Eggs Benedict and Newcastle Brown Ale</h3>
            <p>One of our favourite beer pairings with brunch might have to be the Newcastle Brown Ale with the ever famous eggs benny. The subtly sweet and malty flavour of the ale perfectly offsets the savoury taste of the meat toppings. It comes in at about 140 calories, not bad for a brown ale. So, the neon yellow packaging isn't something you would ordinarily be caught dead with, it does perfectly complement a revitalizing morning breakfast. So does its 4.7% alcohol content. Sunny side up anyone? While the packaging of this brew leaves much to be desired, we are quite happy to give this beer a hearty 4.5 out of 5. I'll cheers to that!</p>

            <h3>Pancakes with Corona</h3>
            <p>To offset the rich, delicious sweetness from your overloaded pancakes, you will need a bitter flavoured beer with a hint of citrus. And no, you don't have to pair Mexican flavours with other Mexican flavours. It's all about diversifying! At 148 calories and 4.5% alcohol content, I wouldn't call it risk-taking. Yeah the nutrition is average and the packaging ain't to write home about, but hey, it's all about that flavour combination. Add a lime, and voila! Or should we say <em>Salud!</em></p>

            <h3>Avocado Toast and Pilsner</h3>
            <p>Okay hear us out. I know your dad and weird uncle used to drink this stuff, but you might be surprised at how well these flavours combine. The hoppy bitterness of Pilsner pairs just perfectly with the subtle, almost buttery taste of avocados. For 145 calories and 5% alcohol content, you can live your hipster dream to your heart's content. You can tell anyone who asks (or who doesn't) that it's a "Bavarian" lager. And you know what? The packaging ain't too shabby either.</p>

            <h3>Belgian Waffles with Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc</h3>
            <p>If this isn't the hipsterest combi of all, I don't know what is. The perfect mixture of citrusy goodness to pair with your sweet or savoury (ever heard of it?) waffles, and you will be instantly transported to a quaint European village. Do you smell that sweet scent of patisserie and cigarettes? The 149 calories and 5% alcohol content are impressively offset by the beauty of the bottle and packaging. Who wouldn't want to be seen holding a bottle of the finest blue bouteille de bi√®re? Best yet, you can pronounce it with your best impression of a French accent, and people might think you made it yourself. Or not.</p>

            <h3>Oatmeal Breakfast Bowl and Glutenberg</h3>
            <p>Last and certainly least of all (if we are to believe the gluten free haters), our wheat free selection. Glutenberg will give your intestines a break while you can pretend to enjoy the likes of Oktoberfest year round. Okay, there's no pretending here, we love our German traditions. Add in a no-nonsense oatmeal breakfast and your Oma would be so proud. For 160 calories and 5% alcohol content, it will gladly replace any gluten heavy beer. And the packaging? Hey, it's pretty okay!</p>
