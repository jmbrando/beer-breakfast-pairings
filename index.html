      <h2>The Introduction</h2>
      <p>After a long hard night of sleeping, the best thing that can brighten up any day is a fresh cold beer with breakfast. You may wonder, is it too early to have beers before noon on a Sunday? We don’t think so. In fact, we believe the time has come to boot the mimosa and the tequila sunrise from their lofty stage on the brunch drinks menu and bring in a new era of pale ales. As if this topic isn’t already fun enough, we will be adding some of our own investigations and opinions to find you the best beers with brunch pairings. Because nothing can spice up an engaging and fascinating subject like research and analytics. </p>
      <p>To start off, we will be choosing some of the most popular breakfasts consumed in North America, then pair them with a matching beer brand. We’ll dig deep into the multidimensional sensations that will combine in your mouth, and use terms such as “hoppy”, “tart”, and “malty” that will make you believe we are beer crafting pros. Now before you throw all your pent-up hipster rage on us for forgetting your favorite alternative category, we will also be including gluten free beer options, because we’re all a little deviant at heart.</p>
      <p>The pairing of beers with breakfast can sound like quite a heavy start to your day but it truly doesn’t have to be. We will provide you with the ingredients and nutritional information on each of our selections, so you can be sure to pick your own poison. Each brew will be scaled on their content of calories, ingredients, and of course, your favourite, alcohol content. If flavour isn’t enough to win you over, maybe the thought of a slizzy morning will. To each their own, but as always, please drink responsibly.</p>
      <p>As a final evaluation, we will be judging each beer on their quality of branding and packaging, to cater to the eager, rosy-cheeked designer in you. Who doesn’t want to look trendy while consuming a delicious pint at their local bistro? Check out our list of beers with breakfast pairings now to decide for yourself which are your favorites and which you wouldn’t hesitate to be seen in public with. After all, choosing beer for your brunch drink of choice is a decision inspired by someone of the utmost confidence and individuality. Or at least, we like to think so.</p>
